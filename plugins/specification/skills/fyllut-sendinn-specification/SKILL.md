# Fyllut-Sendinn specification

Use this skill to create one of two documents:

- A **functional specification** defines who needs a change, why they need it,
  and what the product must do.
- A **technical specification** defines how approved behavior will fit the
  existing system.

Keep the modes separate. Both use the workflow below.

## Start

Ask discovery questions in rounds, written directly in your reply. Do not use
`ask_user` and do not ask one question at a time.

1. **Open the first round.** Always ask whether the user wants a functional or
   technical specification, even when the prompt suggests one. If no change or
   problem was provided, include a separate question asking:

   > What would you like to specify? A rough description is enough.

   The mode question is required and offers exactly two choices: **Functional
   specification** and **Technical specification**. Do not offer an "unsure",
   "other", or any third mode. Recommend the better fit when the prompt
   provides enough context.

2. **Frame the work.** Investigate the current state, then summarize the
   problem, outcome, and boundary. Ask the user to correct the framing.

## Discovery method

- **Map a decision tree.** Track which decisions depend on other decisions.
  The frontier is every unresolved decision whose prerequisites are settled.
- **Ask the whole frontier.** Put every current frontier question in one
  reply. Number questions continuously across rounds, so Q7 in round 3 is
  never confused with Q7 in round 1. Ask a single question only when the
  frontier contains one decision.
- **Wait for the round to be answered.** Do not start the next round, and do
  not draft, until the user has responded. Every answer reshapes the tree:
  settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that
  depended on them. Recompute the frontier after every response.
- **Keep dependencies between rounds.** A question whose answer depends on
  another question still open in this round belongs to a later round. If Q5
  depends on Q2, do not ask them together.
- **Find facts; ask for decisions.** Read documentation, code, tests, current
  behavior, terminology, issue conventions, and prior art. Do not ask the user
  for facts available through tools. If research is still running, continue
  with independent frontier questions and hold only the questions that depend
  on that research.
- **State what you found.** Before a round, summarize the facts your research
  settled, so the user can see which questions no longer need asking and can
  correct a wrong finding before it becomes a decision.
- **Keep questions focused.** Each question must contain one decision. Do not
  combine unrelated choices just because they are asked in the same round.
- **Keep questions concise.** Use a short title, one brief sentence explaining
  why the decision matters, and a short recommendation. Omit context already
  established in the conversation or available in the repository.
- **Give a recommendation.** State a preferred option and a short reason. It is
  advice, not an assumed answer.
- **Accept uncertainty.** "I don't know" is valid. If research, a prototype,
  user testing, policy, content, or another owner is needed, stop that branch
  and record the dependency.
- **Name the owner.** For an external decision, record who must answer, what
  they must decide, what it affects, and when it is needed.
- **Use consistent terms.** Resolve vague or overloaded language before using
  it in the document.
- **Track status.** Separate verified facts, confirmed decisions, accepted
  assumptions with risks, and open questions.

Write each question in this format:

```md
**Q<n> — <title>**

<The choice, in one or two sentences.>
*Recommendation: <choice and reason>*
```

Introduce a round with a heading such as **Round 2**, so the user can see
which answers belong together.

The interview is complete when the frontier is empty: every relevant branch
has been visited and no decision remains silently assumed. Confirm shared
understanding before drafting. Do not draft while a blocking question remains.

## Writing standard

Write for people who need to understand and act quickly.

- Use short sentences, familiar words, and concrete verbs.
- State decisions directly.
- Keep each bullet, requirement, criterion, and table row to one idea.
- Use bullets and tables only when they improve scanning.
- Do not repeat a point unless repetition adds useful traceability.
- Do not invent benefits, risks, or requirements to fill a section.
- Leave out contracts, projections, and models with no consumer in the current
  scope.
- Avoid filler such as "seamless", "robust", "flexible", "intuitive",
  "appropriate", "comprehensive", "leverage", and "best practice".
- Use "Not applicable" with a short reason when a required section does not
  apply.

Before approval, remove repetition, vague wording, irrelevant detail, long
sentences, and unnecessary formality. The document must stand on its own
without the discovery conversation.

## Functional mode

### Audience and scope

Write for functional architects and designers. Use plain product language.
Discuss users, tasks, journeys, business rules, content, states, and recovery.

When the request proposes a component, API, field type, or other technical
solution, first establish:

1. who needs it;
2. what they cannot do today;
3. what successful behavior looks like;
4. why the current product is insufficient.

Treat the proposed solution as context, not as an approved requirement.

Do not ask the user to choose internal components, APIs, schemas, storage,
algorithms, timeouts, event timing, expression syntax, or safeguards. Ask for
observable behavior and leave implementation to technical planning.

### Discovery

Confirm:

- affected users and their goal;
- current behavior and problem;
- product surface and entry point;
- desired outcome and success signal.

Use the
[functional discovery question bank](references/functional-discovery-question-bank.md)
selectively. Use concrete examples when a broad answer hides ambiguity.

Follow repository instructions and invoke applicable repository skills before
asking detailed questions. Treat their established architecture,
accessibility, interaction, boundary, error handling, security, observability,
and testing defaults as verified constraints rather than user decisions.
Continue to ask about feature-specific behavior and contracts that are not
already defined.

### Ready to draft

Draft when:

- users, problem, journey, scope, and outcome are clear;
- normal, alternate, and recovery behavior is decided;
- relevant conditions have observable outcomes;
- content owners, dependencies, and unchanged behavior are known;
- no blocking functional question remains.

Technical questions do not block this document. List them for technical
planning. After a substantial interview, ask if a user, journey, rule, or
consequence is missing.

### Specification format

```md
# <Outcome-oriented title>

## Context and problem
<Affected users, their goal, and the current problem.>

## Goal and success
<Required outcome and success signal.>

## Scope
### Included
- <Capability or journey change>

### Not included
- <Boundary>

## Users and permissions
| User or role | Need | Access or restriction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <role> | <need> | <restriction> |

## User journeys and behavior
### <Journey>
1. <Starting context>
2. <User action>
3. <Product behavior>
4. <Completion or recovery>

## Functional requirements
1. **FR-1:** <Observable behavior and conditions.>

## Design and content
<Required experience and content.>

## Accessibility requirements
- <Observable WCAG 2.2 AA requirement.>

## Edge cases and recovery
| Situation | Required behavior | Recovery or information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <situation> | <behavior> | <recovery> |

## Dependencies and constraints
- <Product dependency or constraint.>
- <Topic for technical planning.>

## Assumptions and open questions
- **Accepted assumption:** <Basis, risk, and owner.>
- **Non-blocking question:** <Decision, owner, and deadline.>

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] **AC-1 (FR-1):** <Normal outcome.>
- [ ] **AC-2 (FR-1):** <Alternate or failure outcome.>
- [ ] **AC-3 (Accessibility):** <Accessibility outcome.>
```

Requirements must remain useful if the implementation changes.

## Technical mode

### Audience and scope

Write for developers. Use precise engineering language and inspect the
repository before recommending a design.

Identify the functional basis first: an approved specification, issue, explicit
requirement, or verified existing behavior. Do not hide unresolved product
behavior inside a technical decision. Pause and recommend functional discovery
when needed.

Follow repository instructions and applicable repository skills before asking
design questions. Treat established package, interaction, boundary, error,
security, observability, and testing rules as constraints. Do not repeat those
rules in the technical specification; describe only how the proposed design
applies them or intentionally differs.

### Discovery

Verify the current design, package direction, dependencies, interfaces,
operational constraints, nearby tests, and prior art. Confirm the proposed
technical boundary before detailed questions.

- Separate the source of truth, lookup or context source, presentation state,
  and target contracts before choosing a shared boundary. Current lookup usage
  does not by itself make an artifact part of the shared contract.
- Name the consumer for every field in a proposed shared model. Leave
  display-only data in its current source of truth when no target consumer
  needs it.
- State exactly which layer is shared: semantics, source data, lookup,
  resolver, mapping, service, or UI behavior. Do not require existing flows to
  share a broader layer when sharing a narrower one meets the goal.
- Separate framework or runtime replacement from migration of definitions,
  persisted data, integrations, and application behavior. State which
  dimensions are replaced, adapted, migrated, or unchanged.
- Name the owner and enforcement point for each validation rule. Distinguish
  user-facing collection validation, application-boundary parsing and
  security, and downstream domain acceptance.

Use the
[technical discovery question bank](references/technical-discovery-question-bank.md)
selectively. Ask developers to choose trade-offs, not report facts available in
the repository.

Follow specialist routing in the applicable repository guidance.

Name stable packages, modules, services, and contracts when useful. Avoid line
references, exhaustive file lists, and production code. Include a small schema,
state transition, or interface only when prose is less precise.

### Ready to draft

Draft when:

- the functional basis and technical goal are clear;
- current state, boundaries, and dependencies are verified;
- concurrent work and the existing or in-flight contracts to reuse are
  identified, and overlapping contract ownership is resolved;
- normal processing, failures, retries, and recovery are designed;
- compatibility, migration, security, privacy, and operations are resolved or
  marked not applicable;
- testing and rollout can prove the design;
- meaningful alternatives and trade-offs are recorded;
- no blocking technical question remains.

After substantial discovery, ask if a dependency, failure mode, or operational
effect is missing.

### Specification format

```md
# <Technical outcome title>

## Functional basis
<Approved behavior and source.>

## Technical goal
<Engineering outcome and success measure.>

## Current state
<Verified design, constraints, and prior art.>

## Concurrent work
- <In-flight branch or specification touching the same package or contract.>
- <Existing or in-flight definition to reuse.>
- <Taxonomy, validator, or error model not to duplicate.>

## Scope
### Included
- <Technical responsibility>

### Not included
- <Boundary>

## Proposed design
<Design, responsibility split, and rationale.>

## System flow
1. <Input>
2. <Processing and owner>
3. <External call or state change>
4. <Result or recovery>

## Interfaces and contracts
| Boundary | Input | Output or guarantee | Compatibility |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <boundary> | <input> | <output> | <compatibility> |

## Data and state
<Ownership, lifecycle, validation, consistency, and retention.>

## Failure handling and recovery
| Failure | Detection | Handling | Recovery |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <failure> | <signal> | <behavior> | <recovery> |

## Security and privacy
- <Requirement or not-applicable reason.>
- <For each verified identity, what it replaces and what it must not replace;
  separate the actor from the subject or resource.>

## Observability and operations
- <Signal, alert, owner, or not-applicable reason.>

## Migration and compatibility
- <Rollout, compatibility, rollback, or not-applicable reason.>
- <For replaced extraction or mapping, currently accepted values that remain
  accepted, including optional fields, fallback chains, and unvalidated
  pass-through values. Treat first-time validation as a behavior change.>

## Testing strategy
| Seam | Behavior proved | Test level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <seam> | <guarantee> | <existing test type> |

## Decisions and alternatives
1. **TD-1:** <Decision, reason, trade-off, and rejected alternative.>

## Assumptions and open questions
- **Accepted assumption:** <Basis, risk, validation, and owner.>
- **Non-blocking question:** <Decision, owner, and deadline.>

## Technical acceptance criteria
- [ ] **TAC-1 (TD-1):** <Compatibility outcome proved by unchanged artifact.>
- [ ] **TAC-2 (Failure):** <Failure and recovery outcome.>
- [ ] **TAC-3 (Operations):** <Operational outcome.>
```

When the design enumerates a fixed set of valid combinations, prefer a
representation that cannot construct an invalid combination. Record a decision
to validate combinations at runtime, with its trade-off, in **Decisions and
alternatives**.

A compatibility criterion must name the artifact that proves it and state that
the artifact must not change. Changing a test input or expectation is a
behavior change, not a way to satisfy the criterion.

Specify enough to guide implementation without listing every code edit.

## Optional prototype validation

After presenting the complete draft, always offer these three choices in your
reply:

- **Approve the specification**
- **See a prototype**
- **Revise the draft**

Recommend **Approve the specification** unless there is a reason not to.

Recommend prototype validation when the draft depends on an interaction,
screen, conditional journey, state change, or recovery flow that is easier to
judge by trying it. Otherwise recommend approval or revision.

When prototype validation is selected, follow
[the prototype validation workflow](references/prototype-validation.md). Add
the verdict to the draft, apply any revisions, and offer the same three
choices again. Do not ask for a handoff until the user approves the
specification.

## Approval and handoff

Before approval:

- remove contradictions;
- cover each requirement or decision with acceptance criteria;
- replace vague terms with observable or verifiable outcomes;
- separate facts, decisions, assumptions, and questions;
- remove generated-sounding, promotional, repetitive, or formal wording;
- confirm no blocking question remains.

Only **Approve the specification** is explicit approval. Anything else means
prototype validation or revision.

Before handoff, follow any repository-specific skill maintenance instructions
provided by the skill that invoked this one.

After approval, ask the user to choose the handoff. Offer these three choices
in your reply:

- **Create GitHub issues**
- **Create a Copilot plan**
- **Exit — no specification handoff is needed because the initial prompt is
  already clear**

Recommend one option and say why:

- Recommend **GitHub issues** when the work is too large for one implementation
  plan, should be split into several plans or tickets, crosses teams or system
  boundaries, needs staged delivery, or requires a lasting decision record.
- Recommend **Copilot plan** when one coherent implementation plan can cover
  the work, the scope is owned by one team, and no product or technical
  decision remains open.
- Recommend **Exit** when the initial prompt was already narrow, unambiguous,
  low-risk, and implementation-ready, so preserving a specification would add
  no useful clarification or coordination.

Do not recommend based only on diff size. Consider behavioral reach,
dependencies, operational risk, and how many independently deliverable pieces
the work contains.

## GitHub issue handoff

Create as many issues as the work actually has independently deliverable
pieces, and no more. Most specifications need one issue.

### Choosing the shape

**One issue** when the work is a single deliverable: one repository, one
reviewable change set, nothing that has to land or deploy in a particular
order. Use the approved draft unchanged as the body.

**One issue per piece, plus a main issue**, when the work splits into pieces
that different people could pick up in parallel, that live in different
repositories, or that must be merged or deployed in a set order.

Do not split a single repository's work into one issue per file, per layer, or
per commit. If the pieces would be reviewed in one pull request, they are one
issue.

### When there is one issue

1. Use the approved draft unchanged.
2. Add only requested labels or labels verified for this issue type.
3. Create it with
   `gh issue create --title <title> --body-file <temporary-file>`.
4. Remove the temporary file.
5. Return the issue URL.

### When there are several issues

Ask the user which repository should own the main issue if the specification
does not already say. The main issue is the authoritative record; the
implementation issues are working instructions.

1. **Create the main issue first.** Its body is the approved draft. State at
   the top that it is authoritative and that the implementation issues link
   back to it. Add an implementation section containing:
   - a table of the implementation issues, with repository, what each depends
     on, and whether it can start immediately;
   - the merge and deploy order, and which pieces are genuinely parallel;
   - the rollback point, when the work changes production behavior.
2. **Create one implementation issue per piece.** Each one:
   - opens by naming the main issue as authoritative and telling the reader to
     read it first;
   - lists only the changes in that repository, with concrete file paths;
   - lists only its own acceptance criteria;
   - names its dependencies and its position in the deploy order;
   - gives the repository's build and test commands.
3. **Do not duplicate the rationale.** Reference decisions by their tag, such
   as `TD-2`, instead of restating the reasoning. A reader who needs the "why"
   follows the link. A decision recorded in two places will eventually
   disagree with itself.
4. **Link the issues back.** Use `navikt/<repo>#<number>` for cross-repository
   references, and `#<number>` within the same repository.
5. **Fill in the main issue's table** once the implementation issues exist and
   their numbers are known. Verify the links resolve.
6. Remove the temporary files and return every issue URL.

Create the issues with `gh issue create --repo navikt/<repo> --title <title>
--body-file <temporary-file>`, or run `gh` from each repository's working
directory. Confirm each repository's remote before creating anything there.

## Other handoffs

For Copilot plan, keep the approved specification in the conversation and tell
the user to enter:

```text
/plan
```

The user does not need to copy the specification. A skill cannot activate an
interactive slash command.

For Exit, do not create an issue or plan. State that no specification handoff
was created because the initial prompt is sufficient.
