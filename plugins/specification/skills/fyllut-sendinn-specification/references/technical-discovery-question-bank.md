# Technical specification discovery question bank

Use this selectively after the functional basis and technical boundary are
known. Investigate repository facts before asking the developer. Ask the whole
current frontier in one round, with one decision per field, and explain each
relevant trade-off. Apply defaults from the relevant development skill without
asking the user to choose them.

## Current state and boundaries

- Within the established package direction, which service or module should own
  the responsibility, and why?
- What current behavior or contract must remain compatible?
- Is there an existing abstraction or integration that should be reused?
- Which in-flight branches or specifications touch the same packages or
  contracts, and which definitions must this design reuse rather than
  duplicate?
- Does the proposal deepen an existing module or create a competing path?
- Which layer is shared: semantics, source data, lookup, resolver,
  mapping, service, or UI behavior?
- Are source-of-truth data, lookup context, presentation state, and target
  contracts being kept separate?
- Which upstream and downstream consumers are affected?
- What is deliberately unchanged?

## Interfaces and data

- What inputs, outputs, errors, and guarantees cross each boundary?
- Which system owns each piece of data and its lifecycle?
- Which consumer needs each field in a proposed shared model?
- Which layer owns and enforces each validation rule: frontend collection,
  application boundary, or downstream domain service?
- Are ordering, idempotency, concurrency, or consistency guarantees required?
- How are invalid, missing, stale, duplicated, or conflicting inputs handled?
- Does data require migration, retention, deletion, encryption, or audit?
- How will old and new producers or consumers coexist during rollout?

## Failure and recovery

- What can fail at each external or state-changing step?
- Which failures are retryable, and how are duplicate effects prevented?
- What must fail closed, degrade, queue, or surface to an operator?
- How is partial completion detected and recovered?
- What rollback or manual recovery path is required?
- Which timeout, capacity, or dependency outage changes the design?

## Security and privacy

- What trust boundaries, identities, roles, and permissions are involved?
- What sensitive or personal data enters logs, storage, events, or external
  services?
- What abuse cases or untrusted inputs require controls?
- Are consent, retention, audit, or compliance requirements applicable?
- Which security decision needs specialist review?

## Observability and operations

- Which signals prove success, degradation, and failure?
- What logs, metrics, or traces let an operator diagnose the flow end to end?
- Which conditions require an alert, and who owns the response?
- Is a dashboard, runbook, or support procedure required?
- What capacity, cost, or service-level constraint matters?

## Testing

- What is the highest stable seam that proves the behavior?
- Which existing tests provide the closest prior art?
- What contract, compatibility, failure, and recovery cases need coverage?
- At which repository-approved test seam can each behavior be proved?
- How will the design be verified in a realistic environment before rollout?

## Migration and rollout

- Can the change be introduced incrementally while keeping the system working?
- Is expand-contract, backfill, dual-read, dual-write, or versioning needed?
- For a framework or runtime replacement, which definitions, persisted data,
  integrations, and application behaviors are replaced, adapted, migrated, or
  unchanged?
- How are existing forms, drafts, submissions, or integrations affected?
- What feature gating or staged rollout is required?
- What is the rollback point, and what state remains after rollback?

## Alternatives and decisions

- What is the simplest viable design consistent with repository direction?
- If valid combinations are fixed, can the design make invalid combinations
  impossible to construct? If not, what runtime-validation trade-off is
  accepted?
- Which meaningful alternative was rejected, and why?
- Is the decision hard to reverse or expensive to change later?
- Which assumption carries the greatest implementation or operational risk?
- What evidence or prototype would resolve the remaining uncertainty?
