# Triage and fix a bug

Own the path from the first symptom to a reviewable pull request. Keep confirmed
facts separate from hypotheses, and do not patch around an unexplained failure.

## Decide whether to file an issue

If the user does not say whether to create a GitHub issue, ask right away
whether they want to track the bug in an issue or want a fix on a feature branch
without an issue. Do not start the investigation until they answer.

## Investigate

1. Read repository guidance and load every skill relevant to the affected code,
   tests, mocks, and local services.
2. Preserve unrelated work. Inspect repository status before changing anything.
3. Build a timeline from logs, request traces, metrics, and user actions. Parse
   structured logs instead of relying on broad text searches.
4. Follow the failing data through each application boundary. For
   cross-repository bugs, give separate subagents non-overlapping repository
   scopes and reconcile their findings centrally.
5. Trace the behavior to source, tests, and contracts. State what the evidence
   proves, what it only suggests, and whether the receiving service is rejecting
   invalid input correctly.
6. Write concrete reproduction steps before choosing a fix.
7. Verify the reported failure before committing to a fix. Report whether the
   bug is confirmed, cannot be reproduced, or needs more detail. For a
   confirmed bug, name the code path that causes it.

## Handle incomplete reports

If the available evidence cannot confirm the bug, ask focused, actionable
questions. Record what is established and what still needs an answer so that
later investigation does not repeat work.

## File the issue when requested

If the user wants an issue, search open and closed issues first. File it in the
repository that owns the faulty behavior, not merely where the error was
logged.

Include:

- observed behavior and impact
- evidence and request timeline, with sensitive values removed
- root cause and relevant source locations
- reproduction steps
- affected flows that share the same code
- suggested solution and regression coverage

Do not paste complete source files or claim that absent log data proves a fact.

After identifying the root cause and filing the issue, explain the findings and
suggested fix to the user. Wait for their confirmation before writing code.

## Resume an existing issue

Read its body, comments, and previous triage notes. Check for replies to
unresolved questions, present the updated evidence, and do not ask again about
facts already established.

## Implement and prove the fix

1. Unless the user explicitly says otherwise, fetch `origin/main` and create
   the feature branch from that updated remote branch. Use an isolated worktree
   when requested or when the current checkout contains other work.
2. Use repository-pinned tools and follow its test-data and mock conventions.
3. Add the regression test before the production change. Prefer an assertion on
   a persisted value, API payload, test-case fixture, or other external contract
   over a DOM-only assertion.
4. Run the narrow test against the unfixed production code and record the exact
   relevant failure. Do not rewrite history just to manufacture a red run.
5. Implement the smallest root-cause fix. Keep downstream validation strict and
   do not silently discard malformed data.
6. Run the regression test again, then the smallest related unit, type, lint,
   build, and end-to-end checks required by repository guidance.

## Review and publish

1. Review the complete diff for races, false-positive tests, shared-flow gaps,
   and unrelated changes. Use a read-only reviewer when available.
2. Fix review findings in a new commit. Re-run affected checks.
3. After the fix passes its tests and you verify the behavior, create
   conventional commits with required trailers, push the feature branch, and
   open a pull request against `main` unless the user specifies another base
   branch.
4. If an issue exists, put `Closes #NUMBER` in the pull request body. Explain
   the cause, behavior change, red-before-green proof, and validation commands.
5. Watch the pull request until all checks pass. Fix failures, push the changes,
   and repeat until the checks are green.
6. Verify the remote branch, pull request body, target branch, linked issue, and
   repository status before reporting completion.

Finish with the issue and pull request links, commit SHAs, regression failure,
passing checks, and any CI or deployment work that is still pending.
